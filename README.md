# libft

The Libft project holds a special place in my programming journey as it was my first major C project, and served as a solid foundation for my future projects.

During the development of Libft, I wrote my own library of functions from scratch, replicating the behavior of functions found in the standard C library (libc). 
This involved implementing a wide range of functionalities, covering string manipulation, basic memory management, and more.

Throughout the project, I encountered various challenges that ultimately helped me to gain a deeper understanding of concepts such as memory allocation and pointer manipulation, 
as well as exploring the inner workings of the standard C library.This really strengthened my programming skills and also boosted my confidence in tackling more complex coding tasks.

## Usage
  - simply run make in the folder to compile the library
